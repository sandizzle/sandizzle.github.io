`print "Hello, World!"`

Hi, I’m Sandip Agrawal. Glad to finally have my own domain. A special thanks to fellow Sandip Agrawal, who owned this domain before and decided for some reason it wasn't worth it to keep it. Thanks, mate!

### Top 3 reasons for starting this blog (in no particular order):

#### Improve my writing
Let’s make it clear. I am a horrible writer. English, not being my first language might have something to do with it. I hope this blog is a step in the right direction. Why is writing important? Paul Graham puts it in Writing, Briefly:

Writing doesn’t just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you’re bad at writing and don’t like to do it, you’ll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated.

#### Have an online presence
Through this blog, I aim to create and maintain an internet presence. Instead of me having to give my twitter, facebook, linkedin or [insert your favorite social networking site] info, I can just point people to my blog.

#### Share my views
Just like everyone, I have opinions about everything. Here, I will post my views on things I care about, stuffs I have a love/hate relationship with. And of course, there will be updates on what’s happening in my life. So, stay on board!
