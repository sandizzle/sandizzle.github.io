`print "Hello, World!"`

Hi, I’m Sandip Agrawal. I am so happy to have finally got my own domain. A special thanks for fellow Sandip Agrawal, who owned this domain before and decided for whatever reason it was not worth it. Thanks, mate!

### Top 3 reasons for starting this blog (in no particular order):

#### Improve my writing
Let’s make it clear. I am a horrible writer. English, not being my first language might have something to do with it. But I am committed to improve. I hope this blog is a step in the right direction. Why is writing important? Paul Graham puts it in Writing, Briefly:

Writing doesn’t just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you’re bad at writing and don’t like to do it, you’ll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated.

#### Have an online presence
Through this blog, I aim to create and maintain an internet presence. Instead of me having to give my twitter, facebook, linkedin or [insert your favorite social networking site] info, I can just point people to my blog.

#### Share my views
Just like everyone, I have my opinion about things that surround us. Here, I will post my views on things that I care about, stuffs I have a love/hate relationship with. And of course, there will be updates on what’s happening in my life. So, stay on board!

Of course, I can’t improve without you. Yes, YOU! Please drop a line if at any point you have any comment or suggestions for me. It could be a note on my poor writing, your likes/dislikes on any topic or even if to just say Hi!
