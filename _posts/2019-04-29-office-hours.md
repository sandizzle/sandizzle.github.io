title:  Pick my brain / AMA
date:   2019-04-29

I would like to offer some of my time/expertise to anyone who think they could benefit from it.

### What?
**45-minute** friendly session to pick my brain. These sessions are completely **free** and available to everyone. I have the time and want to give back.

I’d like to however keep it informal and low pressure. We can talk about absolutely anything you want but here are the areas where I believe I would be the most useful.

### Computer Programming
I’ve been a software engineer for the last 8+ years focusing on Web Applications, and more recently, Machine Learning. I completed my undergrad in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Duke University and my masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning from Georgia Tech. I have previously worked at both big companies ([Google](https://www.youtube.com/), [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/)) and small startups ([DriveInformed](https://www.driveinformed.com/), Hitpost).

- how to become a software engineer
- leveling up as a programmer
- deep dive on certain programming techniques, technologies and/or tools
- working as a remote freelancer (digital nomad)
- discuss technical aspects of a project you want to build

### Travel
I have travelled full time for 2-3 years visiting 33 countries spanning 5 continents.

 - get ideas/inspiration for travel
 - collecting airline miles (and never paying for flights) or finding cheap flights
 - traveling on a budget

To find a time to chat, email me at **chat@sandipagrawal.com** with a little note about you and what you are interested in talking about!
