Hi! My name is Sandip Agrawal.

I am a **Machine Learning / Full Stack Engineer** based out of San Francisco. I am passionate about building scalable web applications and using machine learning to solve interesting problems.

Previously, I have worked at both big companies (Google, Yahoo!) and smaller startups (DriveInformed, OnSports).

I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning from Georgia Tech. I did my undergraduate degree from Duke University with a major in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering.

I was born and raised in Nepal but have been living in US since 2006.
