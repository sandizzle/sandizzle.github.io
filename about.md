Hi! My name is Sandip Agrawal. 

I am a software developer/consultant based in San Francisco. I am passionate about building web applications and am always in the lookout for interesting project ideas. You can learn about some of the projects I have worked on [here](/projects).

I am currently working as a software engineer at OnSports. Before OnSports, I worked as a software consultant at TriTek Solutions. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer.

I completed my Master's with specialization in Machine Learning from Georgia Tech. I did my undergraduate degree from Duke University with a major in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering. I also studied abroad for a summer in Geneva, Switzerland.

I was born in Nepal and moved to United States for my undergraduate degree in 2006 and have been here since then. I speak English, Nepali and Hindi fluently.


Soccer enthusiast, sunset chaser, dancing machine, high on life.
