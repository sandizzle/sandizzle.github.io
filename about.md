Hi! I'm Sandip.

I am a **Machine Learning / Full Stack Engineer** based out of San Francisco. I am passionate about building scalable web applications and using machine learning to solve interesting problems.

Previously, I have worked at both big companies ([Google](https://www.youtube.com/), [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/)) and early stage startups ([Informed](https://www.driveinformed.com/), OnSports).

I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning from Georgia Tech and my undergraduate degree from Duke University with a major in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering.

I was born and raised in Nepal but have been living in US since 2006. I love traveling and so far have been to *38* countries.
